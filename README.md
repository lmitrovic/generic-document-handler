GeRuDok is a generic document handler located within the project. We can have multiple projects in the one workspace. Each document can contain page elements in the form of a circle, square or rectangle. It is possible to resize, drag and drop and rotate each page element. We can place textual content or an image in the page element. Serialization is also enabled, everything we have done can be saved in the selected location and re-imported into the workspace.
